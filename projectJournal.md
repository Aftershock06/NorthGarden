1. reSetup the github
2. Setup in the enviro-grow 
3. Setup the ada-fruit.io site to gather the data
4. updating the webfiles with visual studio code but having issues with merging files with extension

1. trying to build out the program and do a test run
2. I was able to use this script in the terminal to test the POST and it worked 
    ```
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"time": "04-08-2023 13:58","temperature": 20.5, "humidity": 50, "light": 75}' http://192.168.86.43/gardendata
    ```
3. the current issue is that the pico is not actively recording data.
